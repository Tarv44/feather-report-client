      Looking to show off what makes each of your amazing products special? Feather report is a platform that businesses can use to give their customers an easy-to-use process for comparing and contrasting the features of each of their products.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why "Feather Report"? The goal is to provide customers the option to compare products "of a different feather" while keeping the process focused on just the important details or, in other words, making the report "light as a feather."
